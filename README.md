### Accessibility Assistant

### Product Overview
Accessibility Assistant is an **AI-powered assistant** designed to help visually impaired users navigate any app or device interface through intelligent, conversational voice interaction.  
It reads content aloud, describes on-screen elements, and provides voice-based navigation, all while learning the user’s preferences and adapting over time.

### Why It Matters
Existing tools like **Narrator** or **ChromeVox** only work on a per-app basis and often rely on rigid accessibility tags that don’t cover every visual element.  
Accessibility Assistant goes further, it operates at the **operating system level**, dynamically interpreting any screen layout and translating it into natural, human-like descriptions and commands.

This ensures a more intuitive, independent, and personalized digital experience for visually impaired users.

### Who It Is For
- **Visually Impaired Users** - who need real-time guidance across apps or system screens.  
- **Developers** - looking to integrate accessibility APIs into their products.  
- **Assistive Technology Companies** - aiming to improve accessibility experiences.  
- **Operating System Vendors** - who want to embed advanced accessibility intelligence natively.  

### Key Features
- **Screen Understanding AI** - Scans the UI layout in real time to interpret buttons, text, and images.  
- **Voice-Based Navigation** - Users can issue commands like “Open Messages” or “Scroll down.”  
- **Text-to-Speech (TTS)** - Reads content aloud naturally using neural voice synthesis.  
- **Visual Scene Description** - Describes images or interfaces in human-friendly language.  
- **Context Awareness** - Understands and adapts to what’s happening on screen.  
  - e.g., *“You have a new WhatsApp message from your contact, darling. Would you like me to open and read it aloud?”*  
  - *“There is a photo of two people smiling. Do you want me to open it?”*  
- **Personalized Learning** – Learns user habits and preferred commands for faster interactions.  
- **Accessibility Scanner** – Detects issues like missing alt text, poor color contrast, or small tap areas.    
- **Contrast & Font Adjuster** – Enables users to customize visual elements for better readability.  
- **Accessibility Score Dashboard** – Displays overall accessibility ratings and improvement suggestions.  
- **Cross-App Operation** – Works across apps, not limited to a single platform.


### Technologies Used
- **Frontend:** Electron.js (for cross-platform desktop interface), React.js (UI dashboard)  
- **Backend:** Python (FastAPI) for AI interpretation & orchestration  
- **AI/ML Layer:**  
  - Vision models (CLIP, YOLOv8) for scene understanding  
  - NLP models (GPT or LLaMA) for conversational interpretation  
  - Speech APIs for voice input/output  
- **Database:** PostgreSQL for user profiles & preferences  
- **Speech Technologies:** Web Speech API, ElevenLabs TTS / Whisper ASR  
- **Hosting:** Render / AWS Lambda  
- **Version Control:** GitHub  

### Project Goals
Accessibility Assistant aims to:
- Help visually impaired users operate any app or system independently.  
- Replace rigid screen readers with a natural, context-aware assistant.  
- Set a new standard for real-time, adaptive accessibility.  

### Future Enhancements
- Integration into Android and Windows OS layers.  
- Multi-language voice and object recognition.  
- Offline mode for on-device assistance.  
- Emotion recognition in visual descriptions.
